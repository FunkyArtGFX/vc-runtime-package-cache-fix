# vc-runtime-package-cache-fix
Easy 1-Click Fix for broken Microsoft Visual C++ Package Cache on Windows 10/11

## 🤯 Why This Exists

After hours of searching for a quick and reliable fix, I found that no clear solution existed for this issue.
Most guides were outdated, incomplete, or overly complicated — and none worked consistently.
Common recommendations included reinstalling Visual C++, repairing Windows or editing the registry — none of which reliably fixed the broken Package Cache problem.

After encountering this issue multiple times across different systems, I decided to stop wasting time and create a single, automated, one-click solution that actually works.

### 🎯 The Goal

This project exists to provide:
- one simple script
- no guesswork
- no manual folder creation
- no risky registry edits

Just:

> run → fix → done

If this repository saves you hours of frustration, then it has done exactly what it was created for
